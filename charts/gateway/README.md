# Gateway

Gateway is an HTTP proxy to the various gRPC services within the [deps.cloud](https://deps.cloud) ecosystem.
It translates RESTful API calls into gRPC calls for interacting with modules and their dependencies.

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a Gateway deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.16+
- Helm 3.0+

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```bash
$ helm install my-release depscloud-incubator/tracker
```

The command deploys Gateway on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration.
The [Parameters](#parameters) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```bash
$ helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Parameters

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the Gateway chart and their default values.
